# GANs - Generative Adversarial Networks

# 1. DCGAN - Deep Convolutional GAN

[Train a small DCGAN using Keras on the Celeb-A dataset.](https://github.com/joshmurr/machine-learnings/blob/master/cci-dsai/DCGAN_Keras.ipynb)

[Train a similar DCGAN on your own dataset created using a YouTube video](https://github.com/joshmurr/machine-learnings/blob/master/cci-dsai/DCGAN_Keras_Cutsom_Dataset.ipynb)

# 2. BigGAN

# 3. __TASK!__ - StyleGAN

StyleGAN is a household name in the machine learning world. It really made a name for itself by being the first model to make extremely convincing, relatively high resolution images of human faces (and pretty much anything else). This stoked the _how-will-we-ever-trust-an-image-again?!_ fire. Regardless StyleGAN is an amazing model and great fun to play with.

Your _in class_ task is to run through the notebook and then project an image of _your face_ (or something else if you'd prefer not to) into the latent manifold of StyleGAN.

# 4. __HOMEWORK__ - Pix2Pix

Your __homework__ this week [work through  this notebook](https://github.com/joshmurr/machine-learnings/blob/master/pix2pix/pix2pix2webcam.ipynb) to train a Pix2Pix GAN. Much like the DCGAN notebook above you will be able to generate a dataset from a YouTube video you download. A Pix2Pix GAN is an image-to-image translation model, which means it takes an image as input and gives you an image as output. Providing the image is the right shape and number of channels, we could give our model any image we want! In this notebook the model has been prepared in the same way that [Memo Akten et al. prepared their model](https://vimeo.com/260612034) which sets it up for webcam interaction.

We'll  share and compare the models we have trained next week!

If you have any problems feel free to reach out to Murad or Josh on Slack - but the most important thing is to read the text in the notebook and __run every cell__.
