# 1. DCGAN - Deep Convolutional GAN

# 2. BigGAN

# 3. StyleGAN

StyleGAN is a household name in the machine learning world. It really made a name for itself by being the first model to make extremely convincing, relatively high resolution images of human faces (and pretty much anything else). This stoked the _how-will-we-ever-trust-an-image-again?!_ fire. Regardless StyleGAN is an amazing model and great fun to play with.

__TASK!__ - Your _in class_ task is to run through the notebook and then project an image of _your face_ (or something else if you'd prefer not to) into the latent manifold of StyleGAN.
